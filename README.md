# GitHub Actions CI and Peer Review Workflow

This project demonstrates how to automate code quality checks using GitHub Actions and Super-Linter, while following a development workflow with peer code reviews.

## Features

- CI setup with Super-Linter (.github/workflows/lint.yml)
- Automatic linting on every push or pull request
- Development takes place in the dev branch
- Code is reviewed and approved before merging into main

## Collaboration

- A classmate was added as a collaborator
- A pull request was created from the dev branch
- The classmate reviewed and approved the changes
- The pull request was merged into main and successfully linted

## CI Status

Super-Linter runs on every push or merge to ensure clean and consistent code.  
Check the Actions tab in the repository for logs and workflow results.
