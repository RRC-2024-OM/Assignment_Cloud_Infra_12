# âœ… GitHub Actions CI & Peer Review Workflow

This project demonstrates how to automate code quality checks using **GitHub Actions** and **Super-Linter**, while following a **dev â†’ main** development workflow with **peer code reviews**.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- CI setup with Super-Linter (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`)
- Auto-linting on every push or pull request
- Branch-based workflow (`dev` for development, `main` for production)
- Peer collaboration via pull requests and reviews

## ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration
- Invited a classmate as collaborator
- Created PR from `dev` branch
- Classmate reviewed and approved changes
- Merged into `main` with successful Super-Linter run

## âœ… CI Status
> Super-Linter runs on every push/merge to ensure clean, consistent code.

Check the **Actions** tab for full logs and workflow runs.

_This assignment showcases basic CI/CD principles, peer teamwork, and code linting best practices._
